<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Courier, monospace"><font size="4">Dear Cousins:-<br/>
<br/>
                   Having looked forward to this
              letter (not with delight) for a matter of six weeks or two
              months, and having, from time to tire received gentle
              hints, or, better yet, very carefully worded duns from <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a>; ­"who
              by the way has been very patient", I think it about time I
              made some kind of an attempt to use up some of the paper
              he has sent me. <br/>
<br/>
                   I was raking leaves this
              afternoon and it made me think that perhaps, I might be
              shoveling snow from the same place before many weeks have
              gone. I can't make it seem possible our summer is over. <br/>
<br/>
                   In regard to my work, ‑ I am
              agent and operator for the New York Central rail road
              Company at Ansonia, Pa., ‑ two miles from where we live at
              Asaph. I drive back and forth in summer, and walk in
              winter. Just at present, traffic on the Railroad is rather
              heavy and we are unusually busy. The greater part of
              traffic on this Division is Bituminous Coal from the
              Pittsburgh District. <br/>
<br/>
                  Ansonia is located eleven miles
              from Wellsboro on Pine Creek and at this time of the year
              the mountains here are wonderful. Only wish you people
              could be here and enjoy them with us. Hunting and fishing
              is of the best,- bear, deer, partridge, squirrels and
              rabbits in abundance. Trout (Brook and German Brown), bass
              and pickerel. Don't it make your mouth water and your
              blood tingle?<br/>
<br/>
                  I personally am looking forward
              and making plans for November 1st, when the hunting season
              will be open. Perhaps I may be disappointed; for two years
              now I have made the same plans, and found it impossible to
              fulfill them on account of shortage of help on the
              Railroad, but am living in hopes this year.<br/>
<br/>
                   My <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Mother</a>
              and also <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I456">Mother






                Seely</a> live alone in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osceola_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">Osceola</a>.
              We get over to see them about once a week during the
              summer. Only wish we could all be together, but habits of
              a life time are hard to break, and our Mothers seem to
              think there is only one town in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
                   We have been unable to get the
              photos for the reason that we are seldom in Osceola in the
              daytime when it is possible to take pictures and as we
              want the three of us on one picture, will have to send
              them later. Am very sorry I couldn't get them in for this
              half.<br/>
