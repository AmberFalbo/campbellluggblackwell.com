      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> It would seem that such a delightful spring day should inspire my
        unskilled pen to a letter worthy of a place in the Campbell Cousins
        Correspondence.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Some time ago I received a letter from <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin
          Will</a> inviting me to contribute a letter but I little thought that
        I should be the sole representative of our family but such seems to be
        the case, unless my sister <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">Elizabeth</a>
        is able to write.</p>
      <p> My <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">mother</a>, who is of course
        the most important member of the family, seems to have been much in
        demand this winter.</p>
      <p> On March 5th, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">Betty</a>
        presented a sturdy son to the Hoyt family and also of course to the
        Campbell Clan. Needless to say, his "Gram" Hoyt had to be there to see
        that <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1282">David
          Roy</a> was properly welcomed into this world. She had been back with
        me only a few weeks when <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1250">Jess</a>
        sent for her to come to Binghamton<sup>1</sup>. The children all have
        had measles and to make matters worse they were just beginning to get
        better when <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47215">Tom</a>
        and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47217">Henry</a>
        each had an abscess in the ear. Of course this makes it impossible for
        either Mother or Jess to write, as caring for three sick children is
        about all they can manage.</p>
      <p>My Easter vacation<sup>2</sup> begins Good Friday and continues through
        Easter Week. I am planning to spend it at Atlantic City, Philadelphia
        and Harrisburg. I am sure those Cousins who are or have been in the
        teaching profession appreciate my delight at getting away from the
        school room for a few days and then to come back and take up the work
        with renewed enthusiasm.</p>

      <p>While over town to lunch this noon, I met Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I780">Helen
          Wilson</a> she apparently was on that delight of a woman's heart, -- a
        shopping tour.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I have not been in Nelson for some time but at this time of year I
        always feel a particular urge to go up to "The Farm"<sup>3</sup> which
        some of you people still think of as <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Aunt
          Phoebe</a>'s, and then hike up to "The Rocks"<sup>4</sup> which was
        the scene of many good times when we were youngsters.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Anxiously awaiting the C.C.C., I am,<br>
