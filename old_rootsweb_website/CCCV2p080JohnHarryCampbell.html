      <p>April 8, 1924 </p>

    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> and the Rest of
        the Campbell Family:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>The letter from <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">Cousin George Buck</a>
        forwarded me by my <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1477">Mother</a>
        and another from Cousin Will Selph received last evening, reminded me
        that I was not keeping the faith,- that I was not assisting the
        realization of Cousin Will's dream.</p>
      <p>Now what shall I talk about, --myself, the family, France or all three?</p>
      <p>In the Spring of 1922, I had my plans completed for a trip to Germany,
        the steamship reservation made to Hamburg and arrangements settled for
        the study of German Opera. Shorty, before sailing, I received word that
        Germany was not making warm welcome for American Opera singers. Just at
        that time I became interested in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontainebleau_Schools">Conservatoire
          Americain</a>, a summer school of music held in the Royal Palace at
        Fontainebleau, France. Thus instead of Germany, I turned my sights
        toward France.</p>
      <p>The school was so interesting, I came again in June, 1923, bringing my
        family to stay for an indefinite period, and making Paris my
        headquarters. To do this, I was obliged to resign my position as soloist
        in the Marble Collegiate Church<sup>1</sup> in New York, a position I
        had held for fourteen years.</p>
      <p>At present, I am studying the Wagnerian Operas in French<sup>2</sup>
        and doing a bit of vocal teaching. Instead of working in our apartment,
        I go to a studio in the building of the "Elan Spirituel" meaning
        spiritual start or outburst,- a social services center established by
        the Methodist Church. Here I come to work each day, away from the noise
        and confusion necessarily attendant to housekeeping and upbringing of
        two very lively daughters.</p>
      <p>Our little girls, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1480">Catharine</a>,
        aged nine, and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1481">Jane</a>,
        aged seven, go to a private French school near by <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>.
        All of their lessons are in French. You would be surprised at French
        system and thoroughness. What my child of nine</p>

      <p>France is a wonderful country, and we Americans should stand back of
        her in her struggles. It would be a most laudable act and an attempt for
        dong good, if every Campbell who reads this letter would impress on his
        or her congressman the folly of trying to catch German votes by voting
        for relief for Germany, while the latter is now preparing to strike
        France and and repudiate the Versailles Treaty, purchased with the blood
        of our own citizens. Congress should express a voice of confidence in
        France's occupation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Ruhr">Ruhr</a>,
        and the Campbell family would do itself credit should it help to
        accomplish this.</p>
      <p>For some time I have had a desire to do one definite thing towards
        rebuilding the devastated regions of France. If I can bring it about in
        my forthcoming trip to America, I shall try to get to gether <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        the funds necessary to place a bell in one of the stricken churches. It
        would be just great if we as a family unit, could raise the money for a
        church bell, which for all time to come would toll our tribute to France
        and be a recognition of the duty we shall always owe Lafayette.</p>

        and I are sailing for America on April 25th to be there a month. We
        shall leave the children with their governess in Paris, one whom we can
        trust since she's been with us for years.</p>
      <p>During my stay in America I shall visit Mother at 524 W. Gray Street, <a

        Should any of you be interested in my church bell project drop me a line
        at that address. </p>
      <p>During January we had the pleasure of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">Roswell
          Young</a>'s company at dinner. It hardly seems possible that "Ross" is
        old enough to hold a position whereby he goes abroad to purchase goods
        for his firm. Many of you no doubt remember what a cute youngster he was
        at four years of age. He has less hair now than he did then. That's a
        bald remark, rather personal, I'll agree.</p>

      <p>Speaking of hair, my own commences to show a touch of "silver," -- half
        a dozen or so on each temple, just reminding me that time flies.</p>
      <p>We should not put off writing our letters as I have done, for no one
        knows whom we shall be neglecting. My own negligence brought this to
        mind when I heard of Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1891">Hattie
          Campbell</a>'s death.</p>

        will drive me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">Nelson</a>
