    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>Having had the privilege of reading the letters of you all, I have felt
        very much ashamed ever since I let the opportunity pass by to contribute
        my share to this splendid means of renewing friendships and making new
        ones among the Cousins of my dear <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1493">Mother</a>.</p>
      <p>I feel as if I know you all, although many of you I have never seen,
        and I will say that I think the Campbells keep in touch with each other
        more closely than any family I have ever heard of. Congratulations!</p>
      <p>Ever since I have been married, we have lived just outside the city
        limits in a very pretty district Our family consists of only my husband,
        known by every one as <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1502">Jay</a>,
        his name being John, our little girl, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1503">Helen
          Jane</a>, and myself. Helen was eight on January the 12th, -- that is
        the date of my grandfather, <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">John H.
          Campbell</a>'s birth.</p>
      <p> Jay is engaged in the manufacturing business, distilling water and
        making soft drinks. I want to tell you right here that he, too,
        thoroughly enjoyed your letters.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Helen Jane has kept things stirring in this home ever since she
        came to bless it. There are not any dull times except perhaps when she
        is asleep. This fact I have been very thankful for due to the untimely
        passing of my mother.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We spend the greater part of our summers at Lake Keuka and Ontario, all
        being great lovers of water. Helen swam and did all sorts of stunts in
        the water when she was six.</p>
      <p>I am told many, many times that I look just like my Mother and I regret
        that the suggestion of a group picture came too late to have one for
        this installment. Perhaps next time we will have one and you may judge
        for yourselves.</p>
      <p>With love and best wishes to you all, </p>
