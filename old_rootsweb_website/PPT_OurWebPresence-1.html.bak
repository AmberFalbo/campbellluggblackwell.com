          Her 19th century style of cursive writing makes it hard to read and

        This was not the log cabin her grandparents bought from the Beecher
        family, it was one Jane's parents built to live in and raise their
        family. A large family was very important when you were clearing land
        [it was heavily forested with very tall white pine trees, which they
        "girdled" to kill] and turning it into a productive farm,. But the
        family outgrew the cabin they built (eventually 12 children). In later
        years there was a demand for lumber and logs were rafted to Harrisburg
        for sale. But at first, the virgin stands of pine were considered
        "weeds." After trees died they either were burned in place, or were cut
        down, stacked and burned in huge bonfires. Stumps were either pulled or
        burned. When I was a boy, it was still common to see stump fences
        separating pastures. </p>
      <p>They lived on the south side of the river, but waded out to the island
        to gather nuts and berries.</p>
