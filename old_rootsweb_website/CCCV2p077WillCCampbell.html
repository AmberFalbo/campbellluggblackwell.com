      <p>My dear Cousins: </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>It surely has been a long, long time since hearing from you, but now it
        is only a case of casting your bread on the water, and watch the
        returns, and with this delightful anticipation in mind, it makes the
        task of writing a real pleasure. Your letters are like a continued
        story, one can hardly wait for the next issue.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ecapane/CCCV1R2TOC.html">October
          issue</a> was a revelation to me. I never knew there were so many good
        looking people in the east, and to think they are all mine. I at once
        entered on the credit side of my ledger 50% for looks, which brought the
        Campbell stock up to a full quota 100%.</p>
      <p> The winter has been a long one here, not so bad the early part, but
        quite severe since the first of the year. At the present time, there is
        at least eighteen inches of ice on Green Bay. The large Ann Arbor <span
          class="Annotation">[RR]</span> car ferries<sup>1</sup> have been
        coming through daily from Frankford <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        since March 1st, but navigation proper will not open for some time. We
        are quite used to these conditions, but sometimes wish we had cast our
        lot in a less strenuous climate, especially when we get our annual
        letter from <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I916">William,
          Jr.</a>, "Bill" as we call him, was home for the holidays<sup>2</sup>
        and spent his Easter vacation with <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin
          Will Selph</a> in New York<sup>3</sup>. We had several letters from
        him while there, and he could not say enough good things about Will and
        his good <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1604">wife</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1605">daughter</a>.
        He had a wonderful time, and the impressions gained of the eastern
        Metropolis will no doubt remain with him always<sup>4</sup>.</p>

    <div class="Footnote"> 1. Many ferries operated out of FRANKFORT, Mich. Most
      of the Ann Arbor Railroad Company ferries went to Kewaunee, WI or
      Manitowoc, WI, but this one apparently went to Marinette's twin city,
      Menominee, MI. Originally they only carried RR freight cars (usually 24
      per ship), but some of the competitor's lines later carried autos and
      passengers. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBP1uUSRh7g">video</a>.
      For a while, Escanaba, MI was a destination for the ships. Passenger car
      ferry service has been resorted between Frankfort and Kewaunee. Green Bay
      (the bay, not the city) is separated from Lake Michigan by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_Peninsula">Door
        Peninsula</a>. After completion of a short canal, the ship route to
      Green Bay's cities was significantly shortened. Even so they burned 70
      tons of coal a day.. --- wbt.<br>

      2. X-mas vacation from <a href="https://deerfield.edu/">Deerfield Academy</a>
      prep school in Deerfield, MA. You can read Bill's <a href="CCCV2p030W_C_CampbellJr.html">
        CCC letter</a> about that --- wbt.<br>
      <br>
      3. NYC --- wbt.<br>
      <br>
      4. Unfortunately, "always" wasn't that long; Bill died at age 29 --- wbt.
