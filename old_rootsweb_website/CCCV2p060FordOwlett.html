      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> It is with pleasure that I again write a letter for the Cousins
        report. There is not much news for me to write about as I am here alone
        in Knoxville.<br>
      </p>
      <p> Have been very busy this winter. While it has been a long winter, we
        did not have much snow and there was no ice harvested<sup>1</sup> here
        'til after February 1st.</p>
      <p> This spring seems a little late; it was only last night that I heard
        the peepers for the first time and the old saying is that they must
        freeze up three times.</p>
      <p>Yesterday after church and after I had my dinner, I took the "Ford" and
        drove down home, -- got stuck in the mud but after a little effort got
        through all right and reached home. Found <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1102">Father</a>
        and <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Mother</a> alone.</p>
      <p> The boys<sup>2</sup> have been home most of this winter but springtime
        scatters them again. They have made some fine syrup<sup>3</sup> and
        sugar<sup>3</sup>. Mother says the best sugar season they have ever had.</p>
      <p> About Thanksgiving time when I had been down home I met Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie
          Congdon</a> on the train. He says the Cousins are coming to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroudsburg,_Pennsylvania">Stroudsburg</a><sup>4</sup>
        for the Annual Dinner. I am sure that will be wonderful and I hope that
        it will be so that I can meet with you all. </p>
      <p>It is with much pleasure that I have read the last report and I am sure
        this one will be just as interesting, though I may fall down on my part.</p>
      <p>Trusting this finds you all well and hoping for a bright and happy
        summer, I am.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Very truly,</p>

      <p>1. Ice blocks were cut in the winter, then stored in ice houses under
        sawdust and straw for insulation, for later use in ice boxes. - wbt.</p>
      <p>2. Several of Ford's brothers worked on farms in Niagara Co. and
        Orleans Co., in NY during farming weather.</p>
      <p>3. Maple.</p>
      <p>4. It was held at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalls_Creek,_Pennsylvania">Marshalls
          Creek</a>, about 13 miles from Stroudsburg. Charlie had a summer home
        there, with a view of Marshalls Falls. In addition to overseeing his
        music publishing company in NYC, Charlie bought a Pocono resort hotel
        that adjoined his property. The hotel had formerly been a sanitorium. So
        there was no problem having room for people to stay. The properties were
        eventually purchased by Smithfield Township, which will turn them into a
        park. </p>
