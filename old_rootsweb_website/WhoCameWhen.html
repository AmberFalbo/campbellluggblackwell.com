    <h1>Campbells of Nelson, PA</h1>
    <h2>WHO CAME WHEN?<br>
      (Our Best Guess)</h2>
    <h2> APPROXIMATE TIMELINE</h2>
    <p><span id="ParaHead">ca 1776.</span> Teenager <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John
        Campbell</a> arrives in Philadelphia from Scotland, perhaps as a boy
      apprentice tailor. He later opens a tailor shop, and by 1800&nbsp; becomes
      a land agent there. </p>
    <p><span id="ParaHead">ca 1796.</span> Our Campbells move from Scotland to
      N. Ireland, where they lived in Co. Antrim and Londonderry. </p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">ca 1800 - 1802.</span> Newlyweds <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Samuel
        Hazlett</a> and <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sarah "Sally" Campbell</a>,
      John's niece, arrive in the US and settle in Lancaster Co., PA., perhaps
      accompanied by younger brother <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John
        Hazlett</a>. Sam was born in Scotland. Sally and John were probably born
      in Scotland.</p>
    <p> At he same time, or perhaps a couple of years later, Sally's siblings, <a
        href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>, <a href="CampbellMary1779.html">Mary</a>,
      and <a href="CampbellElizabeth1789.html">Elizabeth Campbell</a> (who
      later became nephews and nieces of the above mentioned John Campbell) come
      from N. Ireland to Lancaster Co. and settle there. </p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1803.</span> <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-623">Archibald
        Hazlett</a> is born in Lancaster Co. to Sam and Sally.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1804.</span> <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Clinch-347">Thomas
        Clinch</a>, wife <a href="LuggSarah1777ca.html"> Sarah Lugg </a>, and
      baby <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> leave Avening in
      Gloucestershire, sail from Bristol, England and arrive in Philadelphia. On
      the same ship, also from Avening, are widower <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch
        Blackwell</a>, his children, and several of his siblings. The Blackwells
      owned textile mills in Gloucestershire, but join with others to form "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Township,_Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania">The
        English Company</a>", which bought 110,000 acres of wilderness in
      Lycoming Co., PA, sight unseen. The land was hilly, with thin stony soil
      and heavily timbered. Their farms failed, but Enoch became wealthy by
      lumbering. </p>
    <p> The Campbells and Hazletts were staunch Presbyterians and the Luggs and
      Clinches were Anglicans. Some, perhaps all, of the Blackwells were
      Baptists.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">ca 1804.</span> Sally's sister Mary Campbell,
      marries N. Irelander <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-619">John
        Hazlett</a> (as far as we know unrelated to brothers Sam and John
      Hazlett), either in Lancaster Co. or Mary was already married before
      leaving N. Ireland. Sally's brother John Campbell marries Pennsylvanian <a
        href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bell-23734">Elizabeth Bell</a> and
      moves near Pittsburgh, PA. (It gets confusing with all the John Campbells,
      Joseph Campbells, John Hazletts, etc.)</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1805.</span> Thomas Clinch dies in NYC of yellow
      fever. His widow, Sarah LUGG Clinch marries Enoch Blackwell and moves to
      Pine Twp., Lycoming Co. Sarah leaves daughter Ann Clinch to be fostered by
      Enoch's brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2952">Joshua
        Blackwell</a> and his wife, who raised her near New Hope, Bucks Co., PA.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1806.</span> <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary
        Blackwell</a> is born in Pine Twp. to Enoch Blackwell and Sarah Lugg.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">ca 1806.</span> Sam and Sally Campbell Hazlett move
      to a different farm, possibly in Lancaster, possibly near Stroudsburg, PA.
      Perhaps accompanied by brother John Hazlett. A pioneer, Daniel Strait,
      settles in Tioga Co., PA near a Cowanesque River island owned by a family
      named Beecher. Strait builds a cabin and saw mill, but moves on. Sam
      begins buying his land.&nbsp; Subsequently, Sally's uncle, John Campbell,
      in Philadelphia and her father, <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph
        Campbell</a>, still in N. Ireland, begin buying the island, and land on
      the south bank of the Cowanasque, from the Beecher family. Sam's land is a
      little to the east, on the north side of the river, along what is now
      called Strait Creek.. At that time, only a few, small clearings had been
      made and there were no roads. The small community that grew up there, not
      surprisingly, came to be called <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's
        Island</a>. Later, for reasons unknown, when the first post office was
      opened, postal officials named it <span style="font-style: italic;">Nelson</span>.
      (A similar thing happened in Blackwell, PA. Its post office was named <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Morris</span>. But: a) it's know who that
      was honoring; and b) the community continues to be called <span style="font-style: italic;">Blackwell,</span>
      or sometimes <span style="font-style: italic;">Blackwells</span>. In
      Nelson's case, the name <span style="font-style: italic;">Beecher's
        Island</span> died out. It long continued as the name of the
      Presbyterian church, but even there, newspapers eventually began referring
      to it as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Presbyterian Church of
        Nelson</span>.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1810.</span> Sam completes his purchase of land
      from Daniel Strait. By this time Sam and Sally, have two more children,
      Mary (1807) and Jane Hazlett (1810).&nbsp; Sally's parents, Joseph and <a
        href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary HARPER</a> Campbell, and their younger
      children --- <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane</a>, <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a>,
      Jr. and <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James</a> --- sail from
      Londonderry, N. Ireland to Perth Amboy, NJ, arriving in Oct. and make
      their way to Sam's farm where they are joined by Uncle John Campbell from
      Philadelphia. In late 1810 or early 1811 they all set out for Beecher's
      Island, forming their own wagon train and accompanied by all their
      livestock. According to one account, they arrived on New Year's eve. We
      know they did encounter deep snow during the trek, they found Daniel
      Strait's cabin delapidated, and only a few rusted remnants of the saw
      mill. But the Beecher's cabin apparently was intact. John takes over their
      saw mill. See <a href="NelsonMap.html">Nelson map</a>.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1811.</span> John Hazlett marries Jane Campbell,
      Sally's sister. Some time after that, Sam sells or gives or sells the land
      on the north side of the river, along Strait Creek, to John, and relocates
      to Thornbottom Creek, west of Beecher's Island, and builds a saw mill
      there. As does James Campbell.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1814.</span> <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch
        Blackwell</a>, Jr. is born in Jersey Shore, PA to Enoch and Sarah LUGG
      Clinch Blackwell. (Enoch, Sr. also had a son Enoch by his first wife.
      Early childhood death was so common that their names were frequently
      "reused.")</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1816.</span> Enoch Blackwell, Sr. dies.
      Subsequently, we don't know when, Sarah marries her 3rd husband --- former
      tailor John Campbell. In 1818 Sarah and her two younger children, Mary and
      Enoch Blackwell, move to Beecher's Island. John builds a grist mill and a
      fulling mill (hammers cloth to make felt).</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1821.</span> Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell writes to
      daughter Ann Clinch, suggesting she marry Sarah's nephew, Joseph Campbell.
      Ann Clinch marries Joseph Campbell, Jr. A week later, her half-sister,
      Mary Blackwell, marries Joseph's brother, James Campbell.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1824.</span> Mary CAMPBELL Hazlett dies in
      Lancaster Co. Afterwards, her husband ("the other" John Hazlett) and their
      children move to a farm next to brother John Campbell's. At that time, it
      was near Pittsburgh. Now their properties are part of Pittsburgh's North
      side.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1830.</span> Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell Campbell's
      youngest brother, <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles Byron Lugg</a>,
      and his family come to Tioga Co., PA from Gloucestershire. They initially
      settle in Elkland, but soon relocate to Thornbottom Creek, just west of
      Beecher's Island.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1831.</span> C.B. Lugg and family move back to
      England.</p>
    <p><span id="ParaHead">1833.</span> C. B. Lugg and family return to Tioga
      Co. --- this time for good. They settle in Farmington Twp., up Thornbottom
      Creek.</p>
