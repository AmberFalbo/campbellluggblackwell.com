      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> I hope I am not too late but it seems time just flies, -- a sure sign
        of approaching old age. Days used to seem like weeks, now weeks seem
        like days.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Right now our little town is considerably upset because of diphtheria.
        Every mother is watching anxiously for any sign of ill feeling. The
        schools are closed and every precaution is being taken. Two from <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Seiders-39">Betty</a>'s
        room have it, -- one was taken sick in school. That was a week ago. The
        little girl just back of us has it. Fortunately there are no severe
        cases. Those who have not or rather are not in line for diphtheria are
        falling back on mumps as a substitute.</p>
      <p> Exactly two years ago, April 16th, our little golden haired <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Seiders-40">baby
          girl</a> left us. I hope she is as happy as we are sad without her.</p>
      <p> This winter hardly seemed like winter. It certainly has not been the
        old-fashioned snow bank winter. Our only hard snow was about two weeks
        ago, that was gone the next day. The spring is late, however. Usually by
        this time lilacs are out, leaves are well out, and gardens are about
        made. This year only the very earliest flowers are out. We have peas and
        onions planted, but nothing else.</p>
      <p>I have heard nothing more about the Cousins Dinner but suppose the
        plans are still to have it at <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Congdon-793">Uncle
          Charlie</a>'s<sup>1</sup>. I hope so, for it will be our wonderful
        chance to go and see everybody. Now that Betty is in school, I cannot
        pack up and go any time. She loves school and gets along nicely. She is
        starting music too for she has the Campbell ear for music.</p>
      <p>There is a woman in town who a few days ago told <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Seiders-38">Billy</a>
        she was Scotch and a Campbell. I had hoped to see her before I wrote
        this but could not seem to</p>

    <p>do so. She may be a missing "link," though perhaps it would be better to
      say "Chain" for she is more nearly a perfect 66 than <a href="https://www.aptonline.org/catalog/PERFECT-36-WHEN-WOMEN-WON-THE-VOTE">36</a>.
      Would any such link in our family be possible?</p>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>If any of you come near us on your summer trips look us up. A new road
        directly from Philadelphia to Atlantic City passes near here now. We
        have a big house and it is never loaded. If you find the town you can
        always find the Hardware store<sup>2</sup>, -- the only one in town. It
        meets all trains for it is just across the street from the station.</p>
      <p>Billy joins me in best wishes for those we do not know as well as those
        we do.</p>
