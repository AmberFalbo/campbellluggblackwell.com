      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> This is Monday morning, -- rather cool for this time of year, but we
        are looking for pleasant weather now.<br>
      </p>
      <p> We are usually well. I am rather lame, as usual, but am in hope of
        being better soon if the Lord is willing.</p>
      <p> I am out of practice writing letters, but I hope to succeed with this
        one. I know it is getting time for it to be in New York<sup>1</sup>,
        also it is getting time for us Cousins to be preparing for the next
        Cousins Dinner. With what pleasure we all look forward for the time to
        come. when we can all meet our Cousins and second Cousins<sup>2</sup>.
        It will not be long before we older ones will be gone, and then the next
        generation will take our places, and I hope will carry it on as long as
        there is a Cousin left to take on the work<sup>3</sup>.</p>
      <p>No doubt you will be disappointed in not getting our pictures, but no
        more so than I am. We have not been able to get any yet, but hope to
        have some, some time this summer. We have worked and planned, but
        somehow have failed on the photographs. Do not give up, we will get in
        line if nothing happens more than I know of now.</p>
      <p> I have not seen any of the Cousins this winter, only <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I973">Sue</a>.
        I have not seen <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann</a> this winter, but
        she has her own family to look after, and that is enough for one woman
        to do.</p>
      <p>I cannot get my thoughts together enough to write a very long letter,
        so will bring this to a close. I hope however that you will accept it,
        and look for a better one next time.</p>
      <p>With lots of love to all, will say good-bye,</p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. Letters were mailed to Cousin Will Selph's insurance office in NYC,
        who had his office staff type them up and run off, collate, and bind the
        copies</p>
      <p>2. Unlike the Campbell Reunions, the Cousins Dinners had only been for
        Laura's first cousins and guests invited by the hostess. But by 1924
        they realized the 1st cousins were dying out, so the exclusivity would
        soon cause the dinners to become extinct. Thus their children were
        invited from then on.</p>
      <p>3. Unfortunately the dinners were not kept going. Perhaps they remained
        exclusive too long.</p>
