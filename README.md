# campbellluggblackwell.com
Repository for cambellluggblackwell.com website

Contents for the website should go in "/website/".  The 'main' branch is what actually gets sent to campbellluggblackwell.com on BlueHost.

To make changes, you can change /main/ directly.  However, if you want someone to review them first, or they aren't quite ready, create
a new branch and put your changes there.  Later a pull request can be made to get it integrated into 'main' for you.  This is the safe
way to make changes because anything you do can always be repaired (actually anything can be repaired, so don't worry about making a
mistake).

There is some automatic transfers that happen.  Every time /website/ is changed, a "preview" website is updated automatically.
This site is:

    CampbellLuggBlackwell.github.io/main
   
There will also be similarly named preview websites for any branch that you make too!  For the curious, this is done using github "actions".

You can also transfer from github to BlueHost.  Do that by selecting Actions...and then select the one that copies to BlueHost.
